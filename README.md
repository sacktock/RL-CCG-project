# Reinforcement Learning in Collectible Card Games
Project completed as my dissertation for my undergraduate degree at Durham University.

## About
In my last year (year 3) of my undergraduate degree at Durham University I had to complete a 'Computer Science Porject' or 'Dissertation'. My project was titled "Reinfrocement Learning in Collectible Card Games". The aim of this project is to use the reinforcement learning (RL) framework to construct AI agents to play collectible card games (CCGs) and to see if they overcome the inherent challenges associated with these games. More specifically I aimed to compare Monte-Carlo methods and some different deep reinforcement learning algorithms for the CCG Legends of Code and Magic (LOCM) - a card game specifically designed for AI research and competitions. Please feel free to read the paper associated with this project to get a deeper understanding of what exactly I did.
